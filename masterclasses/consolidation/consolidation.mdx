## Overview

Building a consolidated model is your next step after setting up your data sources. This guide will walk you through using consolidation templates in Francis to create a reliable, efficient consolidation process that meets your organization's needs.

## Getting Started

### Creating Your Model

To begin consolidating actuals across multiple entities, you'll need to create a model in Francis. You have two options:

* **Use a Pre-made Template** (Recommended): Starting with a template provides you with a proven framework that you can customize to your needs. This approach is particularly helpful if you're new to Francis or want to implement best practices from the start.

* **Build from Scratch**: If you have specific modeling requirements or want to replicate an existing Excel or Google Sheets model, you can create a custom model. However, we recommend exploring our templates first, as they often provide valuable structure and save time.

### Mapping Your General Ledger

Once your model is ready, follow these steps to map your general ledger accounts:

1. Navigate to **Mappings** in the top-left corner
2. Review your connected data sources and their associated ledgers
3. Create unified account mappings to ensure seamless consolidation

This mapping process creates a standardized structure for your data, enabling automatic imports and consolidated reporting across all entities.

### Setting Up Entity-Level Forecasting

After establishing your consolidated view, you can create separate instances for individual entity forecasting:

1. Locate your consolidated sheet
2. Hover over the sheet and click the three dots (**...**) menu
3. Select **Split by...**
4. In the modal that appears, create individual instances for each entity

This structure allows you to maintain both consolidated reporting and detailed entity-level planning in one organized system.
