## Overview

When you're managing a group of companies, you'll need to eliminate intercompany transactions to create accurate consolidated reports. We'll guide you through this process, whether your entities share the same currency or operate with different ones.

Choose the approach that matches your situation:

* If all your entities use the same currency, follow our streamlined single-currency process
* If you're working with multiple currencies, use our comprehensive multi-currency approach

## Understanding Eliminations

Intercompany transactions need to be eliminated in consolidated reporting to prevent overstating your group's financial position. Think of it this way: when one of your companies sells to another within your group, the transaction shouldn't affect your overall group performance.

### Working with a Single Currency

When all your entities share the same currency, you can follow these straightforward steps:

1. **Identify Your Transactions**
   * Look for transactions between your group entities
   * Find them in your general ledger accounts or dimension values
   * Separate these transactions into distinct rows in Francis for clear visibility

2. **Create Your Eliminations**
   * Set up a dedicated "Eliminations" instance in Francis
   * Enter offsetting entries for each intercompany transaction
   * Example: For a receivable of 100, create an elimination entry of -100

Remember: Keep your original intercompany data intact for individual entity reporting while eliminating it at the group level.

### Managing Multiple Currencies

When your entities use different currencies, you'll need to handle both the eliminations and currency conversions. Here's how:

1. **Prepare Your Data**
   * Identify all intercompany transactions
   * Convert amounts to your group's reporting currency
   * Note any differences caused by exchange rate fluctuations

2. **Handle Currency Differences**
   * Create adjustment rows for any mismatches
   * Record these adjustments according to your accounting standards (IFRS or GAAP)
   * Use Francis to place these adjustments in the most appropriate location

3. **Verify Your Results**
   * Check that elimination entries offset correctly
   * Confirm currency adjustments are properly recorded
   * Ensure your consolidated figures accurately reflect group performance

Important: If you notice unexpected differences, first verify that the transactions truly match before attributing discrepancies to currency effects. Bookkeeping inconsistencies should be resolved before making currency adjustments.

## Next Steps

After completing your eliminations:

For Single-Currency Groups:
* Review your consolidated reports
* Verify all intercompany transactions are properly eliminated
* Ensure compliance with your reporting standards

For Multi-Currency Groups:
* Double-check your currency conversion calculations
* Review your exchange rate applications
* Set up a regular review schedule for ongoing accuracy
