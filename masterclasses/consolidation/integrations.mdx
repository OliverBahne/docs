## Overview

Bringing your entities' financial data together starts with connecting their accounting systems. We'll guide you through this straightforward process, helping you create a unified view of your financial data for comprehensive consolidated reporting.

## Setting Up Your Connections

### Connect Your Accounting Systems

To connect your accounting systems with Francis:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Organization > Integrations**
2. Browse through our supported integrations, which include:
   * Visma e-conomic
   * Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central
   * Intuit Quickbooks Online
   * Oracle Netsuite
   * Xero

3. Select the integration that matches your entity's accounting system

<Tip>
  When connecting multiple entities that use the same accounting system, you'll need to set up each connection separately. To streamline this process, we recommend having the relevant entity open in another browser tab before starting the connection.

### Alternative Connection Methods

Don't see your accounting system listed? We offer flexible alternatives to ensure you can still bring in your financial data effectively:

1. **Google Sheets Integration**
   This method is ideal for importing trial balances or detailed transactions. It offers several advantages:
   * Reduced risk of manual input errors
   * Support for larger datasets
   * Ability to drill down into individual transactions for detailed analysis
   * Flexible data formatting options

2. **Manual Data Entry**
   Best suited for scenarios with minimal data volumes, this option allows you to:
   * Input monthly aggregates directly into your financial model
   * Copy and paste data from your existing reports

### Managing Multiple Currencies

Working with entities that use different currencies? We've got you covered. You can easily:

* Convert actuals during the import process
* Set your preferred reporting currency
* Ensure all transactions align in your target currency

This streamlined currency handling lets you focus on what matters most: analyzing your consolidated financial data and making informed decisions.
