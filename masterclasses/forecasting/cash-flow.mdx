## Overview

A well-structured cash flow forecast is essential for understanding your business's financial health. While your P&L and balance sheet data come directly from your accounting system, you'll create your cash flow statement separately in Francis. This guide will walk you through using the indirect method to set up your cash flow statement effectively.

## Understanding the Basics

### How Calculations Work

When you use the indirect method in Francis, your cash flow items are created through calculated rows. Here's what this means for you:

* Your formulas remain consistent each month, ensuring reliable forecasting
* Instead of importing actual values directly, your figures are derived from other financial data points

### Understanding Cash Flow Categories

Your cash flow statement will be organized into three main categories:

1. **Operating Activities**
   * Starts with your net income
   * Includes adjustments for non-cash items like depreciation
   * Reflects your core business operations

2. **Financing Activities**
   * Shows money moving in and out from funding sources
   * Includes debt payments, equity investments, and other financing

3. **Investing Activities**
   * Tracks purchases or sales of long-term assets
   * Excludes accumulated depreciation (since it's not a cash transaction)

### Setting Up Your Foundation

Before you start your cash flow forecast, ensure you have:

* A properly structured P&L statement
* An accurately mapped balance sheet

These documents provide the essential data you'll need for your cash flow calculations.

### Key Components: Cash and Retained Earnings

Pay special attention to cash and retained earnings—they're crucial links between your financial statements. These components help maintain consistency across your P&L, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.

### Creating Your Forecast

To build an accurate cash flow forecast, you'll need to:

1. Project your P&L items
2. Forecast your balance sheet components (typically requiring more detailed modeling)
3. Connect these projections using the formulas below

### Understanding Cash Flow Formulas

When using the indirect method, you'll calculate cash flows by looking at changes in your P&L and balance sheet. Here's how to interpret balance sheet changes:

For Assets:
* When assets increase → Cash flow decreases
* Formula: Subtract the change in assets

For Liabilities and Equity:
* When these increase → Cash flow increases
* Formula: Add the change in liabilities/equity

Important: Include all balance sheet movements in your cash flow categories, except for:
* Cash
* Retained earnings
* Accumulated depreciation

This approach ensures your cash flow statement accurately reflects all changes in your financial position.
