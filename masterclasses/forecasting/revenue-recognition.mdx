## Overview

This guide will help you model recognized and deferred revenue effectively in Francis. You'll learn when to recognize revenue, how to track deferred revenue, and how to implement these concepts in your forecasting.

## Understanding Revenue Recognition

### When to Recognize Revenue

Revenue recognition follows a clear principle: record revenue when you deliver services or goods to your customer. For SaaS companies selling annual subscriptions, this means carefully tracking payments received before delivery as deferred revenue.

### The Revenue Journey

Revenue typically moves through these four key stages:

1. **Booking Stage:** Your customer places an order or signs a contract
2. **Invoice Stage:** You send an invoice, creating either:
   - Deferred revenue (for advance payments)
   - Accounts receivable (for later payments)
3. **Recognition Stage:** You record revenue when delivering the service or product
4. **Payment Stage:** Your customer completes the payment

In Francis, you'll primarily work with the Invoice and Recognition stages (stages 2 and 3). To track when you receive actual payments, you can set up additional receivables modeling.

## Practical Examples

### Annual Membership with Events

Let's walk through how a running club manages revenue recognition for annual memberships with three events:

**Scenario:** Events occur in March, May, and August
1. **January (Initial Payment):**
   - Record the full payment as deferred revenue
2. **Event Months:**
   - Recognize one-third of the annual fee as revenue when each event takes place
   - This approach ensures revenue matches the actual delivery of services

### SaaS Annual Subscription

Here's how to handle revenue recognition for a 12-month SaaS subscription:

1. **At Payment:**
   - Record the full annual payment as deferred revenue
2. **Monthly:**
   - Move one-twelfth of the payment from deferred to recognized revenue
   - This reflects the ongoing delivery of your service

## Calculating Your Revenue

### Monthly Recognition Process

To determine your monthly recognized revenue:

1. Start with your service period (example: 12 months)
2. Review your invoiced amounts for this period
3. Distribute these amounts evenly across your service period

When your invoicing varies month-to-month (such as with new customers starting at different times), your recognized revenue will adjust accordingly.

### Setting Up Your Forecasts

To create accurate forecasts:

1. Begin with your invoiced amounts
2. Import data through the Google Sheets integration or enter it manually
3. Consider forecasting at either:
   - Customer level
   - Product level

**Tip:** If you offer multiple products with different service periods, create separate forecasts for each to maintain clarity.

## Understanding Cash Flow Impact

While deferred revenue affects when revenue appears on your income statement, it doesn't change your actual cash receipts. For example:

- If a customer pays $2,400 upfront, you receive that cash immediately
- The revenue recognition schedule only determines when this amount appears on your income statement

On your cash flow statement, you'll see:
- Recognized revenue contributing to net profit
- Changes in deferred revenue appearing as working capital adjustments

For invoices with payment terms, you can create separate accounts receivable models to track timing.

## Importing Existing Forecasts

If you already maintain revenue forecasts outside Francis:

1. Go to your existing forecast (such as in Excel)
2. Copy your recognized and deferred revenue metrics
3. Paste them directly into Francis

This approach lets you:
- Maintain your current modeling workflow
- Benefit from Francis's additional features:
  - Version control
  - Variance analysis
  - Comprehensive reporting tools
