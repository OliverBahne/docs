## Overview

Creating accurate tax forecasts helps you maintain healthy cash flow and meet regulatory requirements with confidence. This guide walks you through how to properly structure and track your tax forecasts in Francis, ensuring you're always prepared for upcoming tax obligations.

## How to Forecast Tax

Tax forecasting in Francis follows a straightforward process that aligns with standard accounting practices. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Record Tax Expenses**
   - Place tax expenses in December to align with standard fiscal year reporting
   - Use the balance sheet to track associated tax liabilities
   - Implement conditional formulas (using `if()` statements) when you need to account for monthly variations

2. **Create Initial Forecasts**
   - Set up a journal entry for your estimated annual tax expense
   - Import this initial forecast directly into Francis to establish your baseline
   - This gives you visibility into future tax obligations before final calculations are available

3. **Handle Updates and Adjustments**
   - When your accountant finalizes the actual tax expenses (typically mid-way through the following year)
   - Import a single adjustment entry to update your forecast
   - This approach maintains clean, traceable records of your tax planning

By following these steps, you'll maintain an accurate, up-to-date tax forecast that seamlessly integrates with your financial model and real-world accounting practices.
