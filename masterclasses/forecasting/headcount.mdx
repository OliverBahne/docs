## Overview

Effective headcount planning is crucial for managing your organization's growth and financial health. While your accounting system tracks actual salary data one way, you often need a different structure for forecasting. This guide will help you bridge this gap and create clear, accurate headcount forecasts in Francis.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up Your Actuals Data

Your chart of accounts likely includes various salary-related items such as:
- Base salaries
- Benefits
- Payroll taxes
- Contractor fees

You have two options for mapping these accounts:
1. Create individual rows for each account type for detailed analysis
2. Combine them into a single row for a higher-level view

<Tip>
  If you're using dimensions in your accounting setup, you can leverage them to analyze salary data by department or employee, giving you more detailed insights into your workforce costs.

### Creating Your Salary Forecasts

To maintain clear and organized headcount forecasts, follow these steps:

1. Create a dedicated tab separate from your main P&L
2. Choose your preferred structure:
   - Group employees by department
   - Create individual groups for each team member
   - List detailed compensation components per person

When forecasting base salaries, you can:
- Enter fixed amounts for stable projections
- Account for planned increases using the `if_month()` function

Here's an example of how to automate annual salary increases:

```typescript
// Applies a 5% increase in January
= "Base salaries"[-1] * (1 + if_month(1) * 5%)
```</fileContent>
