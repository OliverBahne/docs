## Overview

When forecasting receivables, many users assume a certain number of payment days. To simplify this, Francis offers the `receivables()` function.

## Basics

The `receivables()` function accumulates revenue from previous months according to a specified number of payment days. It assumes each month has 30 days and looks back through earlier periods to identify revenue still owed.

Keep in mind:

- The payment days value must be a hardcoded number (not a cell reference).
- If you have multiple revenue streams with different payment terms, use separate `receivables()` functions for each revenue row.
