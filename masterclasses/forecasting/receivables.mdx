## Overview

Forecasting receivables accurately is essential for understanding your future cash flow. To help you achieve this with confidence, we've developed the `receivables()` function that simplifies the process of calculating expected payments based on your payment terms.

## How It Works

The `receivables()` function helps you track expected payments by:
- Analyzing revenue from previous months
- Calculating outstanding amounts based on your specified payment terms
- Automatically adjusting calculations using a standardized 30-day month

## Using the Function

To get started with the `receivables()` function:

1. Determine your standard payment terms (in days)
2. Enter this number directly into the function (for example: `receivables(30)`)
3. The function will automatically calculate expected receivables based on your historical revenue

Important Notes:
- Always use a direct numerical value for payment days rather than a cell reference
- For businesses with multiple revenue streams and different payment terms, create separate calculations using individual `receivables()` functions for each stream

This approach ensures accurate tracking and forecasting of your expected incoming payments.
