## Overview

Selecting the right forecasting method is crucial for accurate financial planning. This guide walks you through seven effective forecasting methods you can implement in Francis. Whether you're looking for simple moving averages or detailed assumption-based forecasting, you'll find clear, practical guidance to help you make informed decisions.

## Core Forecasting Methods

### YoY Growth

Year-over-Year (YoY) growth forecasting helps you account for seasonal patterns in your business. This method is particularly valuable if you're working with retail or e-commerce companies.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="How It Works">
    Take your revenue from the same month last year and apply a growth rate that reflects your expected performance changes. This approach helps you maintain seasonal patterns while accounting for growth.
  </Card>

  <Card title="When to Use It">
    This method works best when your business has clear seasonal patterns and you need to project revenue while accounting for cyclical trends.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

```typescript
// Implementation Example
= "Revenue"[-12] * (1+5%)
```

### Percentage of Revenue

As your company grows, certain costs and balance sheet items typically grow proportionally with revenue. This method helps you maintain these relationships in your forecasts.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="How It Works">
    Calculate items as a percentage of revenue based on historical performance, then apply this percentage to your projected revenue to generate forecasts.
  </Card>

  <Card title="When to Use It">
    Use this approach for items that consistently scale with revenue, such as inventory levels or accounts receivable.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

```typescript
// Implementation Example
= "Revenue"[0] * "COGS % of Revenue"[0]
```

### Moving Average

The moving average method helps you identify trends by smoothing out short-term fluctuations. It's particularly useful when you need to focus on longer-term patterns in stable operations.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="How It Works">
    Calculate an average from your recent months' data, then apply a growth factor to account for expected changes. This helps you maintain trend accuracy while reducing the impact of outliers.
  </Card>

  <Card title="When to Use It">
    Apply this method when you need reliable forecasts for relatively stable metrics across revenue, expenses, and balance sheet items.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

```typescript
// Implementation Example
= AVG_LAST("Revenue",3) * (1+5%)
```

### Annual Inputs

When you have confidence in your annual projections but need flexibility in monthly distribution, the annual inputs method provides a structured approach.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="How It Works">
    Start with your annual forecast and divide it evenly across twelve months to create balanced monthly projections.
  </Card>

  <Card title="When to Use It">
    This method is ideal for fixed costs where you can confidently estimate annual totals but need flexibility in monthly allocation.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

```typescript
// Implementation Example
= -12.000 / 12
```

### Prior Month's Balance

For stable accounts that tend to maintain consistent values, the prior month's balance method offers a straightforward forecasting approach.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="How It Works">
    Simply carry forward the previous month's value when you expect minimal changes in account balances.
  </Card>

  <Card title="When to Use It">
    Apply this method to balance sheet items that remain relatively constant or have limited predictability in their changes.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

```typescript
// Implementation Example
= "Rent"[-1]
```

### Cost per Employee

For companies where employee-related expenses dominate the cost structure, such as software firms, this method helps you maintain accurate personnel-based forecasts.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="How It Works">
    Calculate your average cost per employee using historical data, then multiply by your projected headcount to forecast total costs.
  </Card>

  <Card title="When to Use It">
    Use this approach for employee-linked expenses such as benefits, workspace costs, or equipment allocations.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

```typescript
// Implementation Example
= "Lunch, cost per employee"[0] âˆ— "Total employees"[0]
```

### Fixed Assumptions

When you have specific, predetermined values for certain expenses, the fixed assumptions method provides a reliable way to incorporate them into your forecast.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="How It Works">
    Input your known future expenses directly into your model instead of using formulas. This ensures accuracy for predetermined costs.
  </Card>

  <Card title="When to Use It">
    Apply this method when you have confirmed fixed costs like lease payments, insurance premiums, or scheduled interest payments.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

```typescript
// Implementation Example
= -10.000
```
