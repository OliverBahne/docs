## Understanding Currency Conversion in Francis

Francis implements currency conversion in alignment with IAS 21 standards through two key principles:
- Applying average rates to Profit and Loss (P&L) items
- Using closing rates for balance sheet items

While IAS 21 does not prescribe specific handling for equity accounts, it requires exchange rate differences to be reported in **Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)**, a separate equity component.

## Managing Exchange Differences

By default, Francis distributes exchange rate differences directly to their respective accounts. To ensure IAS 21 compliance, you can redirect these differences for equity accounts to an "OCI" row using formulas. Here's what you need to consider:

1. **Essential Adjustment**: The difference between average rates (P&L items) and closing rates (balance sheet items) must be reflected in OCI. Learn more about this in [Effect 2](/integrations/other/currency).

2. **Optional Adjustment**: You can choose to transfer monthly closing rate adjustments for equity accounts to OCI. For details, see [Effect 1](/integrations/other/currency).
