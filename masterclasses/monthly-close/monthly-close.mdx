## Overview

To ensure accurate financial planning and analysis, you'll need to import your ERP actuals data into Francis after closing your books each month. This guide walks you through the monthly close process, helping you:

* Import and validate your actuals data
* Perform essential controlling tasks
* Update your forecasts
* Analyze variances
* Generate comprehensive management reports

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Importing Your Actuals

To bring your latest financial data into Francis:

1. Go to the bottom left of your screen and select **Sync connections** to import all recently booked entries.

2. Navigate to the **Last close** setting and select your most recently closed month. This ensures Francis works with your latest financial data.

### Performing Control Checks

To effectively review your financial data:

1. Start by comparing forecasts against actuals to identify significant variances
2. Use the detailed drill-down feature to trace variances from forecast values to specific actual entries

Navigate between three essential views using the toggle buttons:

* **Compare:** View the variance between your forecast and actuals
* **Follow-up:** Review your actual values in detail
* **Transactions:** Examine the specific booked entries for any selected cell

**Pro tip:** Reviewing your actuals month by month helps you identify trends and quickly spot any potential bookkeeping discrepancies.

### Updating Your Forecasts

Once you've validated your actuals:

1. Update the **Forecast Start date** to incorporate your newly imported actuals
2. Adjust your future forecasts based on the latest data
3. Save your updated version for future reference and tracking

### Conducting Variance Analysis

To analyze your financial performance:

1. Open the **Reports** view
2. Access comprehensive variance analyses for:
   * Last month
   * Year-to-date
   * Full year

Compare across multiple data sets including budgets, forecasts, actuals, and previous year's figures. You can customize which budget and forecast versions to include in your analysis. Visual charts are available to help you clearly identify and communicate differences between versions.

### Creating Management Reports

To share your financial insights:

1. Select the month-by-month views, charts, and variance analyses you need
2. Export them as PDF packages for simple distribution
3. Use these exported reports for presentations and stakeholder communications

Each report package provides a professional, comprehensive view of your financial performance.
