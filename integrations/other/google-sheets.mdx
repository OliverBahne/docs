## Overview

The Google Sheets integration provides a versatile way to bring your data into Francis from virtually any business tool. This flexible solution enables you to connect your CRM, ERP, or custom data sources through a familiar interface. When your data source isn't supported by Francis' native accounting or currency integrations, Google Sheets offers a reliable bridge to maintain your financial planning workflow.

## Setting Up Your Connection

To connect Google Sheets with Francis:

1. Go to **Settings > Integrations > Google Sheets**
2. Select **Connect with Google**
3. Authorize your Google account

Once connected, Francis creates a dedicated **Francis Data Source** spreadsheet in your Google Drive. This spreadsheet serves as your template for data entry. Each time you sync, Francis automatically imports any new or modified information.

To collaborate with your team, you can either adjust the sharing permissions directly in Google Sheets or move the spreadsheet to a shared drive.

<Tip>
  Francis requests specific, limited permissions to your Google account. We can only view, edit, create, and delete the files we create for you—your other Google Drive files remain completely private and inaccessible to Francis.
</Tip>

### Choosing Your Data Format

Before importing your data, select the template that best matches your needs. Francis offers two options:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Monthly totals">
    Choose this format when working with data that's already aggregated by month. It's ideal for summarized monthly reporting and doesn't support detailed record-level analysis.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Detailed entries">
    Select this format when working with individual transactions or row-level data. This template handles both detailed records and aggregated data, enabling comprehensive analysis and drill-downs within Francis.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Importing Your Accounting Data

Follow these steps to ensure your accounting data imports correctly and maintains its integrity within Francis.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare your data">
    After connecting Google Sheets, format your accounting data according to these standard conventions:

    * For **Income** accounts: Enter negative (-) values
    * For **Expense** accounts: Enter positive (+) values
    * For **Asset** accounts: Enter positive (+) values
    * For **Liability** accounts: Enter negative (-) values
    * For **Equity** accounts: Enter negative (-) values

    Important: For balance sheet accounts (assets, liabilities, and equity), enter delta values rather than cumulative totals, as Francis automatically handles accumulation during import.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable accounting mode">
    Activate the **Treat as entity** setting for your Google Sheets connection. This tells Francis to apply appropriate accounting transformations to your data.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set account categories">
    When prompted, categorize each account type. This ensures Francis correctly processes your data according to standard accounting principles:

    * **Income** accounts become positive (+) values
    * **Expense** accounts become negative (-) values
    * **Asset** accounts remain positive (+) values
    * **Liability** accounts convert to positive (+) values
    * **Equity** accounts convert to positive (+) values
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure consolidation (Optional)">
    If you're consolidating actuals across multiple entities, integrate your new Google Sheets data source:

    1. Open your consolidation template
    2. Select **Adjust split** from the action menu
    3. Choose **Add new sheet**
    4. Locate your Google Sheets data in the **Not yet assigned** group
    5. Drag it to the new sheet
    6. Select **Apply** to save your changes

    Your consolidation will now include the newly imported data.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Keeping Your Data Updated

Updates in Google Sheets don't automatically appear in Francis—you'll need to initiate a sync manually to refresh your data. Before syncing, ensure your data follows the required format to prevent sync failures. If a sync fails, review and correct your source data in Google Sheets, then try again.
