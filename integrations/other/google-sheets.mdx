## Overview

The Google Sheets integration enables you to import data from virtually any business tool into Francis for financial planning. By pairing Google Sheets with third-party integrations, you can connect CRMs, ERPs, or create custom API connections. Use this integration as a flexible option for importing data that is not already supported by Francis’ native accounting or currency integrations.

## Configuration

To set up the Google Sheets integration, go to **Settings > Integrations** and connect your Google account. Francis will create a new Google Sheet called *Francis Data Source* in your Google Drive. To share this sheet with team members, update its permissions in Google Sheets or move it from your personal drive to a shared drive.

<Tip>
  When you configure this integration, Francis requests permission to access your Google account. Francis can view, edit, create, and delete *only* the specific Google Drive files it creates. Francis does not request or gain access to any of your other Google Drive files.

### Data formats

After connecting your Google account, you’ll choose one of two templates — monthly totals or detailed entries — based on how your data is organized. Select the template that best matches your existing format and reporting needs.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Monthly totals">
    Select monthly totals if your data is already aggregated by month and does not require drilling down into individual records. This format is best suited for data that is summarized on a monthly basis.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Detailed entries">
    Select detailed entries if your data consists of individual records or row-level transactions that have not been aggregated into monthly totals. While this template can handle aggregated data, it’s ideal for CSV exports from various tools that require minimal preprocessing. Data imported via this template supports drill-downs in Francis, enabling more detailed analysis and explainability.

## Syncing data

Changes made in Google Sheets do not automatically sync to Francis. To reflect the latest updates in Francis, you must manually initiate a sync. If your data is not formatted correctly and does not meet the required data structure, the sync will fail, prompting you to correct the source data in Google Sheets before attempting again.
