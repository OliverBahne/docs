## Overview

You can easily convert your financial data between different currencies in Francis, helping you translate figures from your accounting system's base currency into your preferred reporting currency. We support both market exchange rates from the European Central Bank (ECB) and custom rates to match your specific needs. To give you maximum flexibility in your reporting, you can use either average rates or closing rates for your conversions.

## Setting Up Currency Conversion

Follow these steps to start converting your financial data:

1. Go to **Settings > Integrations**
2. Add a currency data source
3. Choose between market rates or custom rates (both are configured monthly)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Market Rates">
    Market rates from the European Central Bank offer you automatic, reliable currency conversion. We recommend this option for most users.

    You'll have access to:
    * **Monthly closing rates**: Direct from the ECB database
    * **Monthly average rates**: Calculated automatically as the arithmetic mean of daily closing rates for each month

    These rates update automatically, saving you time and ensuring accuracy.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Custom Rates">
    Custom rates give you control over your currency conversions, particularly useful when you need to follow specific group-level exchange rates.

    Here's what you need to know:
    * Define your currency pairs (for example, EUR/USD)
    * Enter monthly exchange rates manually
    * Your first rate entry will apply to all previous months automatically
    * Remember to maintain up-to-date rates - the system uses zero for any missing future periods
    * You can set both average and closing rates to match your requirements
  </Tab>

### Activating Currency Conversion

To start converting your actuals:

1. Open your accounting integration's configuration settings
2. Select your exchange rate data source
3. Choose your target currency

Francis automatically identifies your accounting system's base currency. For Google Sheets imports, you'll need to specify the base currency manually.

## Understanding the Conversion Process

Here's how Francis handles your currency conversions:

* **Income and Expenses (P&L)**: We use monthly average exchange rates to closely match the timing of your transactions
* **Balance Sheet Items**: We apply monthly closing rates to accurately reflect your financial position at period end

This approach creates two important effects you should be aware of:

#### 1. Current vs. Historical Rates

When we convert your opening balance sheet amounts using current month closing rates, you may notice value changes even without new transactions. This reflects both your financial activities and currency fluctuations.

Here's an example of how exchange rate changes affect your balance sheet:

#### 2. Average and Closing Rate Differences

Since we convert P&L items at average rates but balance sheet entries at closing rates, you may see slight differences in the exchange rates applied to related transactions.

This example shows how these rate differences affect your retained earnings:

### IAS21 Compliance

While Francis's standard approach differs slightly from IAS 21.42 (which requires exchange rate differences for equity to appear as "Other Comprehensive Income"), you can easily configure Francis to follow these guidelines. If you need to comply with IAS21, please refer to our compliance guide for step-by-step instructions.
