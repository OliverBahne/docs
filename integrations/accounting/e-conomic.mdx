## Overview

Connect your Visma e-conomic instance to Francis to streamline your financial data management. This integration automatically imports and consolidates your actuals, making your chart of accounts readily available in the **Mappings** view of your model. From there, you can easily map your Visma e-conomic accounts to corresponding line items in your financial model, ensuring accurate and consistent reporting.

<Tip>
  For data reliability, Francis imports only booked transactions. Draft transactions are not currently supported.

## Setting Up Your Connection

1. Go to **Organization Settings > Integrations > Visma e-conomic**
2. Click **Enable** to start the connection process
3. Follow the authorization prompt to add Francis as an approved application to your Visma e-conomic account

This secure authorization ensures Francis can access only the necessary data for your financial reporting needs.

### Configuring Asset Ranges

If your chart of accounts differs from the default template, you'll need to specify your asset account range:

1. Enter your specific `asset_range_start` value
2. Enter your `asset_range_end` value

<Tip>
  While the standard Visma e-conomic asset range is 5000 to 5990, you may need to confirm these settings even if you use the default range.
</Tip>

### Setting Up Retained Earnings

For charts of accounts that differ from the default template, specify your retained earnings account. The most common setting is 6130 Retained earnings last year.

<Tip>
  To verify your retained earnings account: Open Visma e-conomic and navigate to Regnskab > Systemkonti > Ã…rsafslutning.
</Tip>

## Understanding Data Adjustments

Francis applies specific adjustments to ensure your financial data aligns with industry best practices and supports consistent analysis.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Number Convention">
    Francis maintains a clear and consistent number format:

    * **Positive (+) Values:** Income (I), Asset (A), Liability (L), and Equity (EQ) accounts
    * **Negative (-) Values:** Expense (E) accounts

    This standardization creates uniformity across all models and data sources, making your reports clear and comparable. The accuracy of these conventions depends on correct asset range settings.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Retained Earnings">
    When closing a fiscal year in Visma e-conomic, retained earnings move between two accounts:
    * From: "Retained earnings this year"
    * To: "Retained earnings from previous years"

    Francis maintains clarity by creating a distinct "Retained earnings this year" line, providing a complete view of your retained earnings progression.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Balance Sheet">
    Francis presents balance sheet values as point-in-time accumulated amounts rather than period movements. This approach:
    * Aligns with standard accounting practices
    * Requires using **ENDING** or **DELTA** values instead of **SUM** for balance sheet items
    * Provides accurate financial positioning at your chosen reporting date
