## Overview

Connect your Business Central instance to Francis to streamline your financial data management and reporting processes. This integration enables you to import and consolidate your actuals seamlessly. Once connected, you'll find your chart of accounts readily available in the **Mappings** view of your model, where you can efficiently map Business Central accounts to your financial model's line items.

## Configuration

### Setting up account categories

To ensure accurate data processing, each general ledger account in Business Central needs an appropriate account category. Here's how to verify your account categories:

1. Navigate to **Finance > G/L Account Categories** in Business Central
2. Select **Edit list**
3. Review the **Account Category** for each entry
4. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure all accounts are properly classified

### Working with dimensions

Francis automatically detects your Business Central dimensions. If you use dimensions for detailed financial tracking, you can select your primary dimension for planning purposes. This selected dimension will be available for:
- Creating detailed splits
- Generating breakdowns
- Analyzing financial data at a granular level

### Setting up currency conversion

To automatically convert transactions from your base currency to a target currency:

1. Go to your Business Central connection settings in Francis
2. Locate the **Currency Conversion** section
3. Toggle **Enable currency conversion**
4. Choose between market rates or custom exchange rates

## Understanding adjustments

Francis applies specific adjustments to your data to ensure consistency and clarity in your financial analysis.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Number convention">
    To maintain consistency across your financial reporting, Francis follows these standard conventions:

    **Positive (+) values:**
    - Income (I)
    - Asset (A)
    - Liability (L)
    - Equity (EQ)

    **Negative (-) values:**
    - Expense (E)

    > **Important:** These conventions rely on your asset range configuration. Take a moment to verify your asset range settings to ensure accurate account classification.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Balance sheet">
    Francis displays your balance sheet values as accumulated amounts at specific points in time, rather than as period movements. This approach aligns with standard reporting practices and provides clearer financial snapshots.

    **Best practice:** When working with balance sheet items:
    - Use **ENDING** values to see positions at specific dates
    - Use **DELTA** values to track changes between periods
    - Avoid using **SUM** for balance sheet items, as it may not reflect your actual financial position
