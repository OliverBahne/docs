  <Accordion title="What dimensional planning capabilities are available?" defaultOpen={false}>
    Advanced and Mastery plan users have access to comprehensive dimensional planning features. When you connect your accounting system, we automatically detect available dimensions, enabling you to select and utilize the dimensions most relevant to your financial planning needs.

  <Accordion title="Can I connect multiple accounting systems?" defaultOpen={false}>
    Yes, you can establish connections with multiple accounting systems, whether they're from the same provider or different ones. Our Mappings feature allows you to consolidate these connections, creating a unified view of your general ledgers across all entities. This flexibility helps you maintain comprehensive financial oversight while preserving the organizational structure that works best for your business.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I expand my connection capabilities?" defaultOpen={false}>
    We offer several options to expand your connection capabilities based on your current plan:

    * Core plan users: Upgrade to Advanced or Mastery to access additional connections
    * Advanced plan users: Move to Mastery or add more connections to your current plan
    * Mastery plan users: Add more connections to your existing plan as needed

    Each option is designed to grow with your business needs while maintaining the same level of security and reliability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How frequently is my accounting data synchronized?" defaultOpen={false}>
    You have complete control over your data synchronization timing. While there are no restrictions on sync frequency, you'll need to manually initiate each sync to retrieve the latest data from your connected systems. This approach ensures you always know when your financial data is being accessed and updated.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does the integration modify my accounting system data?" defaultOpen={false}>
    No. To maintain the integrity of your financial records, our integration is designed to only read data from your accounting system. We recommend addressing any data discrepancies directly in your accounting system to ensure accuracy at the source. This read-only approach provides an additional layer of security for your financial data.
