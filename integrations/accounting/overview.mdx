## Adjustments

### Number conventions

Francis follows a consistent convention for interpreting accounts.

* **Positive (+):** Income (I), Asset (A), Liability (L), and Equity (EQ)

* **Negative (-):** Expense (E)

This standardization simplifies comparisons and ensures that reports remain straightforward to interpret. Since Francis relies on your asset range configuration to determine each account’s classification, it’s critical to confirm that your asset range settings are correct.

### Balance sheet accumulation

Francis always presents balance sheet values as accumulated amounts at a specific point in time, rather than as movements over a period. This approach requires an adjustment upon import, ensuring that your balance sheet data aligns with common reporting practices.
