## Overview

By connecting your Oracle NetSuite instance to Francis, you can import and consolidate your actuals. Once integrated, Francis makes your chart of accounts accessible via the **Mappings** view in your model. From there, you can define custom mappings of NetSuite accounts to corresponding line items in your financial model.

## Configuration

To set up the Oracle NetSuite integration, go to **Organization Settings > Integrations > Oracle NetSuite**. After enabling this option, a prompt will appear asking you to authorize Francis as an application in your NetSuite account. Completing this authorization step ensures that Francis can securely access journal entries from your NetSuite environment.

### Account categories

For Francis to process your NetSuite data correctly, each general ledger account must have a valid account category. If you haven’t assigned these categories review your NetSuite settings and ensure that each account is properly classified.

### Currency conversion

Imported transactions from NetSuite can automatically convert from their base currency into a chosen target currency. To enable this feature, open the **Currency Conversion** section of your NetSuite connection settings in Francis and toggle **Enable currency conversion**. You can use either market rates or custom rates for your conversions.

## Adjustments

Francis applies several adjustments to ensure that imported data is aligned with best practices and supports clear financial analysis.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Number convention">
    Francis follows a consistent convention for interpreting accounts:

    * **Positive (+):** Income (I), Asset (A), Liability (L), and Equity (EQ)

    * **Negative (-):** Expense (E)

    This standardization simplifies comparisons and makes reporting easier. Because Francis determines each account’s classification based on your asset range settings, verify that your configuration is correct before proceeding.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Balance sheet">
    Francis presents balance sheet values as accumulated amounts at a specific point in time, rather than as movements over a period. This approach requires an adjustment upon import to ensure your balance sheet data aligns with common reporting conventions.
