<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your accounting system">
    To ensure you have the best possible experience with Francis, begin by [connecting your ERP or accounting system](/integrations/accounting/business-central). This connection enables Francis to automatically sync all your finalized transactions from day one, giving you immediate access to your complete financial history.

    Once connected, your general ledger accounts become directly available in Francis, establishing an automatic sync of actual financial data from your systems.

    <Tip>
      Before you begin: You'll need administrator-level access to your accounting or ERP system to establish this connection. This requirement ensures secure and proper data synchronization between your systems and Francis. If you don't have these permissions, please contact your system administrator.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create your model">
    We've designed Francis to make getting started as straightforward as possible. Begin by selecting one of our carefully crafted templates. These templates serve two important purposes: they help you quickly establish your first model while simultaneously demonstrating key platform capabilities. This approach provides an excellent foundation for the next crucial step: mapping your general ledger accounts.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Map your general ledger">
    After connecting your accounting system, you'll find your general ledger accounts ready to use in the [mappings](/documentation/modeling/mappings) section. Here, you can create custom connections between your accounting system and your Francis financial model. The interface is intuitiveâ€”simply drag and drop accounts from your general ledger to corresponding rows in your model.

    <Tip>
      To create more meaningful financial reporting, you can combine multiple general ledger accounts into single line items. This consolidation helps streamline your model and makes forecasting more straightforward and logical.
    </Tip>

  <Step title="Begin your planning process">
    With your accounting system connected and historical data in place, you're ready to plan your business's future. Francis operates with familiar spreadsheet-like functionality, making the transition from existing tools smooth and intuitive. Take advantage of our purpose-built [functions](/documentation/modeling/functions) to accelerate your forecasting process and improve accuracy.
