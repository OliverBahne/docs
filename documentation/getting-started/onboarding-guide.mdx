<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your accounting system">
    Before you start modeling, we recommend [connecting](/integrations/accounting/business-central) your ERP or accounting system. Once you've connected these systems, Francis will sync *all* finalized transactions since inception, giving you full access to all your data.

    Your general ledger accounts will then be available directly in Francis, enabling you to automatically sync actuals from your connected systems.

    <Tip>
      Most accounting and ERP systems require admin rights to connect with third-party applications like Francis. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to continue.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create your model">
    For new users, we recommend familiarizing yourself with Francis by starting with a template. This approach will allow you to quickly get started and showcase some of the platform's capabilities. It will also enable you to move more quickly to the next step: mapping your general ledger accounts.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Map your general ledger">
    With your accounting system connected, your general ledger accounts will be available through the [mappings](/documentation/modeling/mappings) feature. This allows you to define custom mappings between your connected systems and your financial model in Francis. Simply drag and drop accounts from your general ledger onto rows in your model.

    <Tip>
      General ledger accounts can be grouped together, allowing you to create more meaningful line items throughout your model, making forecasting more intuitive.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start planning">
    With your accounting system connected and actuals at your disposal, you can begin planning the future of your business. Francis works like a spreadsheet, so consider reviewing your existing financial models in Excel or Sheets and replicating the underlying logic. Use purpose-built [functions](/documentation/modeling/functions) to make forecasting faster and more intuitive.
