## Basics

### Profile picture

Your default avatar will be the first and last initials of your account. If the email you've used to sign up to Francis is a Google account and your Google account has a public profile picture, Francis will automatically default to using this picture as your avatar.

### Email address

Your email is determined by the email you used to create your account when you initially joined your first workspace in Francis. Your email address is your unique ID for all organizations you've created or been invited to join. For example:

| Action                                                    | Result                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| You created an organization Acme using jane.doe@email.com | An account was created under jane.doe@email.com and a user was simultaneously created as part of the Acme organization. |
| You have been invited to join organization Alpha          | A user was created in organization Alpha under your account jane.doe@email.com                                          |

<Info>

### Name

The full name property let's you know how other members of your organization refers or sees your account. Again, if you wish to change your full name for any reason, contact [support@francis.app](mailto:support@francis.app) and we'll update your details.

### Leave your organization

To leave an organization where you have an active user, navigate to **Settings > Organization > Members** and select the gear icon next to your name from the members table. Once removed, you no longer have access to the workspace. An Owner or Admin will have to invite your account in order for you to rejoin the organization.

<Tip>
  If you're the last remaining user in an organization, i.e. the organization owner, you're not able to leave the organization. Instead, you'll need to go to **Settings > Organization > General** and select **Delete this organization**. This action is irreversiable.
