## Profile Components

### Profile Picture

Your profile picture helps team members easily identify you across the platform. Francis handles profile pictures in the following ways:

- For standard accounts: Your avatar displays the first and last initials of your account name
- For Google-connected accounts: Francis automatically uses your Google profile picture if one is available

### Email Address

Your email address serves as your unique identifier across all Francis organizations. This address is established when you create your account and remains consistent across all workspaces you join. Here's how it works:

| **Scenario**                                                  | **Outcome**                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Creating an organization (e.g., "Acme" with jane.doe@email.com) | Your account is created with this email, and you become a member of the Acme organization automatically |
| Receiving an invitation to join another organization          | Your existing email address (jane.doe@email.com) is used to create your profile in the new organization |

<Tip>
For company-wide email domain changes, please contact [support@francis.app](mailto:support@francis.app) from your current domain. Our team will help coordinate the transition to your new domain.
</Tip>

### Display Name

Your display name appears in all team interactions within Francis. To request a name change, contact [support@francis.app](mailto:support@francis.app), and our support team will assist you promptly.

### Organization Membership

To leave an organization:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Organization > Members**
2. Locate your name in the member list
3. Click the gear icon next to your name
4. Select **Remove from organization...**

This action immediately removes your access to the organization. To regain access in the future, an Owner or Admin will need to send you a new invitation.

<Tip>
If you're the last remaining member of an organization, you must delete the organization instead of leaving it. To do this:

1. Go to **Settings > Organization > General**
2. Select **Delete this organization**

Please note that organization deletion cannot be undone.
