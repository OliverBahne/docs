## Overview

### Plans

Your billing is based on a fixed amount corresponding to the plan you select. Every plan includes unlimited seats, enabling you to work with your entire organization at no extra cost.

Refer to our [pricing page](https://www.francis.app/pricing) for the most up-to-date information on our plans offering.

### Billing cycle

You can choose either a monthly or annual billing cycle:

* **Monthly**: Your account is billed monthly in advance.

* **Annual**: Your account is billed annually in advance, with a 10% discount on your plan.

<Tip>
  You can currently only self-serve onto monthly plans. Please contact [sales@francis.app](mailto:sales@francis.app) if you wish to subscribe to an annual plan and redeem the discount.
</Tip>

## Manage your billing

Navigate to **Settings > Organization > Billing** to access your plan information and make changes. From here, you can:

* View and change your plan

* Update your payment information

* Update the billing email

* View billing history, including past invoices and charges

### Change subscription

If you change plans or billing cycle, we will automatically pro-rate the difference.&#x20;

For example, if you upgrade from the monthly Core plan (USD 149/month) to the monthly Advanced plan (USD $399/month) halfway through your billing cycle, we'll credit the unused portion of your monthly Core subscription (USD 75) and charge only the prorated amount (USD 199) for the remainder of the month.

If you downgrade to a cheaper plan or shorter billing cycle, you will receive credits for unused time, which are used to offset upcoming invoices and reduce future payments. We do not refund credits.&#x20;

### Cancel subscription

Workspace owners and admins can cancel their subscription under **Settings > Organization > Plans**. The subscription remains active until the end of the current billing cycle, and we do not issue refunds for mid-cycle cancellations. If you're unsure about committing to a full year, we recommend starting with a monthly plan. You can always switch to yearly later to enjoy discounted rates.

### Add VAT number

To add a VAT number during checkout, select *I'm purchasing as a business*. If you already have an existing subscription, navigate to **Settings > Billing > Billing Details > Edit details.** Then, select *Update information* in the Billing information section and enter your company's VAT.

## Special pricing programs

### Partner program

If you work with multiple client workspaces in Francis, you may be eligible for our Partner Program. This program provides a discounted plan structure, priority support, and features that streamline financial planning across multiple organizations. Our discount options include:

* **50% discount** for workspaces where clients are not editors (internal use) &#x20;

* **25% discount** for workspaces where clients collaborate as editors &#x20;

You can manage all client subscriptions under your own account or allow clients to handle billing directly in their workspaces. Should you transfer workspace ownership to a client, that workspace reverts to standard plan pricing. If you're interested in joining or learning more about the program, please contact us at [partner@francis.app](mailto:partner@francis.app).

### Startup program

If you're an early-stage startup, you may qualify for our Startup Program, which offers a 50% discount on the Core plan for up to 12 months. To be eligible, you must:

* Be a new Francis customer

* Have fewer than 50 employees

* Have raised less than $1M in funding

* Be under three years old

If you meet these criteria, consider applying through the form on our website [here](https://www.francis.app/startups#startup-application). If you don't meet the eligibility requirements, we encourage you to explore our other plan options. If you're an investor interested in offering Francis to your portfolio companies, please get in touch to learn more about extended partnership opportunities.
