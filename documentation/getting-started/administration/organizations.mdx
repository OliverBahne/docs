## Overview

An organization is the home for all modeling and reporting for your team. We highly recommend teams staying within a single organization as this is the conceptual model we use when designing the product.

<Tip>
  The person who initially creates an organization is automatically assigned Owner of the organization. To transfer ownership to a separate user, contact [support@francis.app](mailto:support@francis.app).
</Tip>

## Organization settings

Navigate to Settings > Organization > General by clicking the workspace name in the upper left and select **Settings**. Owners will be able to:

* Update the organization name

* Update the default brand color

* Remove Francis branding from PDF reports

* Delete the organization and all its content

* Change plans and update billing information

* Configure organization-specific integrations

### Deleting your organization

Deleting an organization includes deleting user data and all content within the organization. Owners can delete an organization under **Settings > Organization > General**. Please note this action is not reversible.

## Multiple organizations

You can create multiple organizations in Francis under a single account (e.g. tied to a specific email). This is very common for fractional CFOs, who usually manage multiple organizations under a single account, allowing for easy switching without the need for separate logins for each client.

To add an additional organization under an existing account:

1. Click on your organization name in the top left corner

2. Hover over **Switch organization**

3. Select **Create or join organization**

4. Enter the name of the organization you wish to create

<Tip>
  If you have other organizations associated with your account, you'll see a list of these organizations when hovering Switch organization from the drop-down menu.
