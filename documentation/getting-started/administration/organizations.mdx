## Overview

Your Francis organization serves as the central workspace for all your team's modeling and reporting needs. We recommend using a single organization for your team to ensure seamless collaboration and optimal workflow management.

<Tip>
When you create an organization, you automatically become its Owner. To transfer ownership to another user, please contact [support@francis.app](mailto:support@francis.app).
