## Overview

### Plans

Refer to our [pricing page](https://www.francis.app/pricing) for the most up-to-date information on our plans offering.

### Billing

Your billing is based on a fixed amount corresponding to the plan you select. Every plan includes unlimited seats, enabling you to work with your entire organization at no extra cost. You can choose either a monthly or annual billing cycle.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Monthly billing">
    When you select a monthly plan, your account is billed at the start of each billing cycle. We do not provide refunds for cancellations made mid-cycle, so if you decide to cancel, you'll retain access until the end of that paid month.

    Changes to your plan are prorated and take effect immediately. For example, if you upgrade from the Core plan (USD 149/month) to the Advanced plan (USD $399/month) halfway through your billing cycle, we'll credit the unused portion of your Core subscription (USD 75) and charge only the prorated amount (USD 199) for the remainder of the month.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Annual billing">
    When you select an annual plan, your account is billed up front for the entire year, and you receive a 10% discount on your plan. As with other plans, there are no refunds for mid-subscription cancellations. If you cancel before your year ends, you'll still have access until the paid term concludes.

    All subscription changes are prorated and take effect right away. For example, if you upgrade from the Core plan (USD 1,788/year) to the Advanced plan (USD 4,788/year) partway through your annual term, we'll credit the unused portion of your Core subscription (USD 894) and charge only the prorated amount (USD 2,394) for the rest of the year.

## Manage your billing

Navigate to ***Settings > Organization > Billing*** to access your plan information and make changes. From here, you can:

* View and change your plan

* Update your payment information

* Update the billing email

* View billing history, including past invoices and charges

### Update or cancel subscription

Workspace owners and admins can update or cancel a subscription under **Settings > Organization > Plans**. Changes take effect immediately.

* **Monthly Plans:** Adjustments are prorated for the current month

* **Yearly Plans:** Adjustments are prorated for the current year

We do not issue refunds for mid-subscription cancellations. If you're unsure about committing to a full year, we recommend starting with a monthly plan. You can always switch to yearly later to enjoy discounted rates.

### Add VAT number

To add a VAT number during checkout, select *I'm purchasing as a business*. If you already have an existing subscription, navigate to **Settings > Billing > Billing Details > Edit details.** Then, select *Update information* in the Billing information section and enter your company's VAT.

## Special pricing programs

### Partner program

If you work with multiple client workspaces in Francis, you may be eligible for our Partner Program. This program provides a discounted plan structure, priority support, and features that streamline financial planning across multiple organizations. Our discount options include:

* **50% discount** for workspaces where clients are not editors (internal use) &#x20;

* **25% discount** for workspaces where clients collaborate as editors &#x20;

You can manage all client subscriptions under your own account or allow clients to handle billing directly in their workspaces. Should you transfer workspace ownership to a client, that workspace reverts to standard plan pricing. If you're interested in joining or learning more about the program, please contact us at [partner@francis.app](mailto:partner@francis.app).

### Startup program

If you're an early-stage startup, you may qualify for our Startup Program, which offers a 50% discount on the Core plan for up to 12 months. To be eligible, you must:

* Be a new Francis customer

* Have fewer than 50 employees

* Have raised less than $1M in funding

* Be under three years old

If you meet these criteria, consider applying through the form on our website [here](https://www.francis.app/startups#startup-application). If you don't meet the eligibility requirements, we encourage you to explore our other plan options. If you're an investor interested in offering Francis to your portfolio companies, please get in touch to learn more about extended partnership opportunities.
