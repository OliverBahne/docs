## Overview

### Plans

For the most current plan offerings and pricing details, visit our [pricing page](https://www.francis.app/pricing).

### Billing Structure

Your subscription is based on your selected plan's fixed rate. Each plan includes unlimited team members, allowing your entire organization to collaborate without additional costs. You can select either monthly or annual billing to suit your needs.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Monthly billing">
    When you choose monthly billing, your payment is processed at the beginning of each billing cycle. Your subscription remains active until the end of your paid period, even if you cancel mid-cycle. Note that we don't provide refunds for mid-cycle cancellations.

    Plan changes take effect immediately with prorated adjustments. For example:
    - If you upgrade from Core ($149/mo) to Advanced ($399/mo) mid-month
    - We'll credit the unused portion of your Core plan (approximately $75)
    - You'll only pay the prorated amount for Advanced (approximately $199) for the remaining days
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Annual billing">
    Selecting an annual plan gives you a 10% discount, with billing processed upfront for the full year. Your subscription remains active until the end of your paid term, even if you cancel mid-year. Note that we don't provide refunds for mid-term cancellations.

    Plan changes take effect immediately with prorated adjustments. For example:
    - If you upgrade from Core ($1,788/yr) to Advanced ($4,788/yr) mid-year
    - We'll credit the unused portion of your Core plan (approximately $894)
    - You'll only pay the prorated amount for Advanced (approximately $2,394) for the remaining months
  </Tab>

## Managing Your Subscription

To access your billing settings, go to **Settings > Organization > Billing**. Here you can:

- View and modify your current plan
- Update payment information
- Change billing email preferences
- Access billing history and invoices

### Updating or Canceling Your Subscription

As a workspace owner or admin, manage your subscription through **Settings > Organization > Plans**. All changes take effect immediately:

- Monthly plans: Changes are prorated within the current month
- Annual plans: Changes are prorated within the current year

To maintain flexibility, consider starting with a monthly plan if you're unsure about a year-long commitment. You can switch to an annual plan later to benefit from the 10% discount.

### Adding a VAT Number

To include your VAT number:
- During checkout: Select "I'm purchasing as a business"
- For existing subscriptions: Go to **Settings > Billing > Billing Details > Edit details**, then select "Update information" in the Billing information section
