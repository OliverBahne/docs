## Overview

### Plans

Refer to our [pricing page](https://www.francis.app/pricing) for the most up-to-date information on our plans offering.

### Billing

Your billing is based on a fixed amount corresponding to the plan you select. Every plan includes unlimited seats, enabling you to work with your entire organization at no extra cost. You can choose either a monthly or annual billing cycle.

## Manage your billing

Navigate to ***Settings > Organization > Billing*** to access your plan information and make changes. From here, you can:

* View and change your plan.

* Update your payment information.

* Update the billing email.

* View billing history, including past invoices and charges.

### Change or cancel subscription

Workspace owners and admins can change or cancel a subscription under **Settings > Organization > Plans**. Changes take effect immediately.

* **Monthly Plans:** Adjustments are prorated for the current month.

* **Yearly Plans:** Adjustments are prorated for the current year.

We do not issue refunds for mid-subscription cancellations. If you’re unsure about committing to a full year, we recommend starting with a monthly plan. You can always switch to yearly later to enjoy discounted rates.

### Add VAT number

To add a VAT number during checkout, select **I'm purchasing as a business**. If you have an existing subscription, go to **Settings > Billing > Billing Details > Edit details**.

## Special pricing programs

### Partner program

If you work with multiple client workspaces in Francis, you may be eligible for our Partner Program. This program provides a discounted plan structure, priority support, and tools that streamline financial planning across multiple organizations. Our discount options include:

* **50% discount** for workspaces where clients are not editors (internal use) &#x20;

* **25% discount** for workspaces where clients collaborate as editors &#x20;

You can manage all client subscriptions under your own account or allow clients to handle billing directly in their workspaces. Should you transfer workspace ownership to a client, that workspace reverts to standard plan pricing. If you’re interested in joining or learning more about the program, please contact us at [partner@francis.app](mailto:partner@francis.app).

### Startup program

If you’re an early-stage startup, you may qualify for our Startup Program, which offers a 50% discount on the Core plan for up to 12 months. To be eligible, you must:

* Be a new Francis customer

* Have fewer than 50 employees

* Have raised less than $1M in funding

* Be under three years old

If you meet these criteria, consider applying through the form on our website [here](https://www.francis.app/startups#startup-application). If you don’t meet the eligibility requirements, we encourage you to explore our other plan option. If you’re an investor interested in offering Francis to your portfolio companies, please get in touch to learn more about extended partnership opportunities.
