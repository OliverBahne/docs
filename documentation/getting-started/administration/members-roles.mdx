## Overview

Manage your team members and their access levels through the Members page. To access this page, go to **Settings > Organization > Members**. Here you'll find a comprehensive list of your current team members and any pending invitations. As an Owner or Admin, you can manage roles and invite new team members directly from this page.

## Understanding Roles

Francis provides five distinct roles to help you manage your team's access effectively: Owner, Admin, Editor, Viewer, and Limited Viewer. Each role comes with specific permissions designed to support different team needs.

### Owner

The Owner holds the highest level of access and is automatically assigned to the person who creates the organization. As an Owner, you can:
- Invite new team members
- Remove existing members
- Modify team member roles
- Manage all features and models
- Terminate the organization when needed

### Admin

Admins work alongside Owners to manage the organization effectively. As an Admin, you can:
- Invite and remove team members
- Modify roles (except for the Owner's role)
- Access and manage all features and models
- Support team collaboration and workflow

### Editor

Editors focus on hands-on work with your organization's models. As an Editor, you can:
- Access all models within the organization
- Perform modeling tasks
- Handle account mapping
- Create forecasts
- Work on consolidation

### Viewer

Viewers have comprehensive visibility without editing capabilities. As a Viewer, you can:
- View all models within the organization
- Download reports
- Access transaction details
- Track model changes and updates

### Limited Viewer

<Info>
  Limited Viewer roles are available exclusively with Enterprise plans.
</Info>

Limited Viewers receive targeted access to specific sheets or models. This role is ideal for department heads or location managers who need focused insights into particular areas of your financial model. Learn more about managing Limited Viewers in our dedicated [documentation](/documentation/confidentiality/limited-viewers).

## Managing Team Member Access

To remove a team member from your organization, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Organization > Members**
2. Locate the team member's name
3. Click the gear icon next to their name
4. Select **Remove from organization...**

When you remove a team member, they immediately lose access to the organization. While their previous contributions remain intact, they'll need a new invitation to regain access. For security purposes, you won't be able to view the list of previously removed members.
