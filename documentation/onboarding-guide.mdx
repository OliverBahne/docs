<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your ERP">
    Before you start modeling, we recommend you connect your ERP or accounting system. Once you've connected these systems, your general ledger accounts will be available directly in Francis, enabling you to automatically sync actuals from your connected systems.

    <Tip>
      Most systems require admin rights to connect with third-party applications like Francis.&#x20;
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a template">
    For new users, we recommend you familiarize yourself with Francis by starting out with a template. This will allow you to quickly get started, and show you some of the possibilities of the platform. It'll also allow you to more quickly get to the next step, mapping your general ledger accounts.
