## Overview

Splits allow you to efficiently manage multiple entities or department budgets using a powerful combination of templates and consolidation. You'll be able to define specific filters for your entity or dimension data, ensuring organized and accurate financial planning across your organization.

## How Splits Work

### Setting Up Consolidation and Templates

To create a consolidation template:
1. Navigate to your tab settings
2. Select *Split by...* from the action menu
3. Choose your preferred filtering method:
   - Filter by entities
   - Filter by dimension values

You can group dimension values according to your organizational needs. The system will create instances based on your filters, typically representing individual entities or departments.

After applying a split, your model will operate on two principles:
- Structure flows top-down
- Actuals and forecasts consolidate bottom-up

### Understanding Your Templates

#### Consolidation Templates: Your Master Structure

The consolidation template serves as your central control point for:
- Adding components
- Renaming elements
- Rearranging structure
- Removing components
- Defining calculation formulas

Any changes you make to the consolidation template automatically sync across all instances, ensuring consistency throughout your model.

> **Important**: While you can modify the structure in the consolidation template, you cannot edit cell values here. This is because actuals and forecasts are managed at the instance level.

#### Working with Instances

Instances inherit their structure from your consolidation template while maintaining independent control over:
- Actual values
- Forecast data

This design allows you to create and analyze separate forecasts for different business segments while maintaining structural consistency.

<Warning>
  Please be aware of the following important considerations:

  - Creating a split will remove any existing forecasts and manual entries, as these will now be managed at the instance level
  - If you modify your split configuration in a way that removes an instance, all forecasts and manual entries in that instance will be deleted
</Warning>

### Creating Additional Consolidations

Need to analyze specific subsets of your data? You can create additional consolidations by:
1. Creating new tabs
2. Setting up calculations to sum values from different instances

This flexibility allows you to create any custom summaries or views you need while maintaining the integrity of your primary consolidation structure.
