## Overview

Breakdowns help you segment your actuals based on dimensions or entities, giving you greater control and visibility over your data. While consolidation templates handle company-wide segmentation, breakdowns excel at focusing on specific dimensions within your model, allowing you to analyze individual rows in detail.

## Basics

### Working with Dimensions

When you've connected an accounting source and configured dimensions in your source settings, you can create dimensional breakdowns for any rows containing actuals from that accounting system. This powerful feature enables you to:
- View your data segmented by specific dimensions
- Create forecasts for each dimensional segment
- Gain deeper insights into your financial data

### Working with Entities

For entity-specific data segmentation, we recommend using consolidation templates as your primary approach. However, if you need to segment individual rows by entity without creating separate instances, you can apply entity breakdowns.

> **Important:** Keep in mind that using entity breakdowns on individual rows may limit your dimensional planning capabilities. If you're working with multiple accounting systems and need comprehensive dimensional planning, we recommend:
> 1. First using consolidation templates to separate your actuals by entity
> 2. Then applying dimensional breakdowns to each instance

This approach ensures you maintain full flexibility while keeping your data properly organized.</fileContent>
