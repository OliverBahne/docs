## Overview

The Mappings view helps you establish connections between your accounting systems and your financial model. Here, you can efficiently map general ledger accounts from your connected accounting systems to specific line items in your model, enabling automatic import of your actual financial data.

## Managing Your Chart of Accounts

### Viewing Your Accounts

Navigate to the Mappings view to access your general ledger accounts. This view provides:
- A clear view of your financial model structure
- A comprehensive list of accounts from all connected accounting systems

Your accounts are automatically organized into two categories:

- **Active Accounts**: These accounts contain booked entries. The 'Last Activity' timestamp shows when the most recent entry was made. We recommend either mapping or marking these accounts as ignored.

- **Inactive Accounts**: These accounts have never had booked entries. No action is required for these accounts—they'll automatically move to the active category once entries are booked to them.

To help you organize your mappings effectively, accounts are classified into five standard categories based on your accounting system:
- Income (I)
- Expense (EX)
- Asset (A)
- Liability (L)
- Equity (EQ)

### Creating Account Mappings

To map your accounts:
1. Locate the account you want to map in the accounts list
2. Drag the account to your desired destination
3. Drop it onto an existing row or create a new row by dragging to the row names section

You can map accounts to both individual rows and groups in your model. When an account is successfully mapped, you'll see a green dot indicator next to the corresponding row or group, confirming the connection to your accounting system. For more detailed reporting, you can map multiple accounts to the same line item.

### Tracking Unmapped Accounts

The Mappings button displays a notification count showing how many accounts need your attention. This count also appears next to individual data sources, helping you track unmapped accounts for each system.

Think of these notifications as your mapping checklist—they help ensure all relevant accounts are properly connected to your model. To clear a notification, either map the account or mark it as ignored.

### Managing Inactive Accounts

For accounts you no longer use, you can mark them as ignored to keep your mappings organized. These accounts won't appear in your notification count. However, if new entries are booked to an ignored account, it will automatically become active again, and you'll receive a notification to review it.
