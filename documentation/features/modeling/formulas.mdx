## Overview

Francis provides an intuitive formula system that will feel familiar if you've worked with Excel or Google Sheets. While you'll use similar components like cell references, [functions](/documentation/modeling/functions), and mathematical operators, we've enhanced the syntax to be more human-readable and robust for financial modeling.

## Working with Formulas

### Formula Syntax

Francis uses a clear, descriptive syntax that follows this pattern: `"ROW_NAME"[RELATIVE_PERIOD]`. For example, to reference the "Revenue" row's value from 12 months ago, enter:

```typescript
="Revenue"[-12]
```

We've designed this syntax with your needs in mind:

* References are clear and intuitive, using actual row names instead of cell coordinates
* You can confidently move components around without breaking formula references
* Creating rolling forecasts is straightforward since all references use relative periods

### Accounting Conventions

To ensure compatibility with your accounting systems and maintain consistency in your financial models, Francis follows standard accounting conventions:

* Income and balance sheet items use positive values (+)
* Expenses use negative values (-)

This alignment with accounting standards makes it easier to work with imported data from your existing systems.

When calculating subtotals like gross profit, you'll add the components using their natural signs. For example, to calculate gross profit:

```typescript
="Revenue"[0] + "Direct costs"[0]
```

This approach maintains accounting consistency and makes your formulas more intuitive to read and validate.
