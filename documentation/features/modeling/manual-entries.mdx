## Overview

Manual entries provide you with the flexibility to input data directly when you need to import actuals from non-supported data sources or make adjustments to data imported from your [accounting system](/integrations/accounting/business-central).

## Use Cases

### Adjusting Imported Actuals

When your accounting system data requires specific adjustments, you can use manual entries to ensure your financial information accurately reflects your current situation. This feature is particularly useful when you need to:

- Correct temporary discrepancies in imported data
- Address timing differences in financial recordings
- Make period-end adjustments

<Tip>
For long-term data accuracy, we recommend resolving any discrepancies directly in your accounting system. While manual entries provide immediate solutions, maintaining data integrity at the source ensures more reliable financial reporting.
</Tip>

### Importing Data from Additional Sources

Manual entries enable you to incorporate data from sources beyond our native integrations. This feature supports your comprehensive financial planning by allowing you to:

- Input data from specialized accounting systems
- Add financial assumptions and projections
- Include supplementary financial information

<Tip>
For efficient handling of large datasets, consider using our [Google Sheets](/integrations/other/google-sheets) integration. This approach reduces the possibility of manual input errors and streamlines your data import process.
