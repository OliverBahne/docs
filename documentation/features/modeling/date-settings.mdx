## Overview

Date settings are fundamental to unlocking Francis's powerful features. When configured correctly, these settings enable essential functionalities like [rolling forecasting](/documentation/version-control/version-control) and [variance analysis](/documentation/variance-analysis/three-column-report). We recommend familiarizing yourself with these settings before building your models to ensure optimal results.

## Core Settings

### Timeline

The timeline determines the specific months visible in your model. While it doesn't affect your calculations or formulas, it lets you focus on the exact date range needed for your analysis.

<Tip>
When preparing your start-of-year budget, include several months from the previous financial year. This gives you valuable context from historical actuals to inform your planning decisions.
</Tip>

### Forecast Start

The Forecast Start marks the transition point between historical data and future projections, appearing as a purple vertical line throughout your model. This date serves as the crucial divider: all months before it represent actual data, while months after it show your forecast.

When you update the Forecast Start, two key changes occur:

1. Previously forecasted months are updated with actual data
2. Your forecast formulas automatically recalculate to incorporate new actuals

Note that budgets function as specialized forecasts that begin at the start of your fiscal year. The Forecast Start setting helps distinguish between rolling forecasts and budgets. Consider implementing a clear naming convention to easily differentiate between these two types of projections.

<Tip>
Before adjusting the Forecast Start, create a snapshot of your model using the versions feature. This preserves your previous forecasts for future reference in charts and reports.
</Tip>

### Last Close

The Last Close indicates your most recently completed accounting period and appears as an orange line in your model. This date must be either equal to or later than your Forecast Start, and it defines which actual data is available since your Forecast Start. Updating the Last Close won't affect your forecasts but enables powerful comparative analysis.

After updating the Last Close, you can access two key analysis features:

1. Use the follow-up and compare tools for detailed [BVA (Budget Variance Analysis)](/documentation/variance-analysis/month-by-month) within your model
2. Generate comprehensive [variance reports](/documentation/variance-analysis/three-column-report) comparing actuals against budget

<Tip>
Align your Last Close updates with your monthly closing process to ensure your variance analysis always reflects the most current data.
