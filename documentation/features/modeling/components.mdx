## Overview

Understanding Francis's five core components will significantly enhance your modeling efficiency. Each component serves a specific purpose in building your financial model, and knowing when to use each one will help you create well-structured, maintainable models that integrate seamlessly with other Francis features.

## Core Components

### Rows

If you're familiar with spreadsheets, you'll feel right at home with Rows. They serve as the foundation for your forecasts and actual financial data. Each Row allows you to:
- Create custom formulas in individual cells
- Connect directly to your general ledger for actual data
- Track forecasted values across time periods

To incorporate your actual financial data, go to the [*Mappings*](/documentation/modeling/mappings) view and link your general ledger accounts to specific rows in your model.

<Tip>
A green connection indicator shows that a Row is linked to external data, while a gray indicator means no external connection exists.
</Tip>

### Calculations

Calculations provide consistency across time periods in your model. They're particularly valuable when you need to derive values from other rows. Use Calculations for:

- Creating subtotals and calculating margins
- Developing key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Generating cash flow statement calculations

<Tip>
For cash flow statements, use Calculations to reference your P&L and balance sheet items when calculating cash movements using the indirect method.
</Tip>

### Groups

Groups organize your model by containing related Rows and Calculations. They automatically sum the values within them, making them ideal for structuring:

- Revenue streams
- Direct costs
- Operating expenses
- Balance sheet categories (Assets, Liabilities, Equity)

<Tip>
When creating formulas, reference Groups rather than individual Rows or Calculations where possible. This approach automatically incorporates any new items you add to the Group, eliminating the need to update formulas manually.
</Tip>

### Sections

Sections help you organize your model's layout without affecting calculations. They can contain Groups, Rows, and Calculations, allowing you to structure your model into logical divisions such as:

- Profit and loss statements
- Balance sheets
- Cash flow statements
- Revenue forecasts
- Key assumptions and drivers

<Tip>
Plan your Section structure with reporting in mindâ€”PDF reports are generated based on your selected Sections.
</Tip>

### Sheets

Sheets enable you to segment your model across multiple views, similar to tabs in traditional spreadsheets. You can easily:
- Create references between Sheets using [formulas](/documentation/modeling/formulas)
- Organize related components together
- Maintain a clear separation between different aspects of your model

<Tip>
Francis's intuitive drag-and-drop interface and robust [formula syntax](/documentation/features/modeling/formula) allow you to reorganize components across Sheets while maintaining all references intact.
