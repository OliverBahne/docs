## Overview

Descriptions help you add valuable context to your financial models, making collaboration more effective and transparent. As an Admin or Editor, you can add explanatory notes to rows, groups, and calculations, enabling clear communication of important details such as forecast assumptions or budget context to your team members.

## Adding and Viewing Descriptions

Follow these steps to work with descriptions:

1. To add a description:
   - Locate the information icon next to any row, group, or calculation
   - Click the icon to open the description dialog
   - Enter your explanatory text
   - Save your changes

2. To view a description:
   - Hover over any information icon that has a description
   - A tooltip will appear showing the stored description

## Template Descriptions

When working with template-based sheets, descriptions serve as centralized documentation for your team. Here's what you need to know:

- Descriptions can only be set on the template level, not in individual instance sheets
- This approach ensures consistent communication across all budget contributors
- Template descriptions help standardize understanding of components across your organization

By using descriptions effectively, you'll create a more informed and aligned financial planning process for your entire team.
