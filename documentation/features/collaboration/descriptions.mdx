## Overview

Admins and Editors can add descriptions to rows, groups, and calculations to improve collaboration and transparency. These descriptions are intentionally primitive, enabling teams to use them for various purposes. Common applications include noting forecast assumptions or offering additional context to budget contributors.

## Basics

### Setting descriptions

Descriptions can be added to rows, groups, and calculations by selecting the information icon. This opens a dialog box allowing you to enter free text explaining the purpose of the specific component. Once a description is added, it becomes visible to other users who can view it by hovering over the icon, which displays a tooltip containing the description.

### Descriptions on templates

By design, descriptions cannot be set on components in an instance sheet after a tab breakdown. This approach lets finance teams centrally describe a component's purpose, enabling more efficient and streamlined communication with budget contributors.
