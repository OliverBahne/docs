## Overview

Status indicators enable clear team communication by highlighting areas of your model that need attention or review. With four distinct status options, you can effectively track progress and coordinate with budget contributors across your model. The straightforward design allows your team to define and implement status meanings that best suit your workflow.

## Using Status Indicators

### Assigning Row Status

To set a status for any row in your model:
1. Go to the row you want to update
2. Click the action menu for that row
3. Select your desired status from the four available options:
   - No status (default)
   - To do
   - In progress
   - Done

### Understanding Status Propagation

Status indicators automatically flow up through your model's hierarchy to provide clear visibility at every level:

- When you assign a status to any row within a group, that status affects the group's overall status display
- If rows within a group have different statuses, the group will display the most critical status ("To do")
- This hierarchical display helps you quickly identify areas requiring attention, even when working with collapsed groups

This automatic propagation ensures that important status information remains visible regardless of how your model is organized or displayed.
