## Overview

Version Control enables you to track and compare different versions of your financial model throughout the year. When you finalize a budget or forecast, you can save a snapshot of your model to use in charts, variance analyses, and reports.

## Creating and Managing Versions

### How to Save a Version

1. Navigate to the top bar of your workspace
2. Click the *Versions* button
3. Select *Save version* from the side drawer

Your saved version will appear on the version timeline, where you can access it at any time.

<Tip>
  Create clear, descriptive names for your versions that include time indicators. For example:
  - "Q1 2024 Reforecast"
  - "3+9 Forecast 2024"
  - "Annual Budget 2024"
</Tip>

### Using Saved Versions

You can use saved versions to:

- Compare budgets, forecasts, and actuals
- Create comprehensive [reports](/documentation/variance-analysis/three-column-report) by selecting an anchor budget and a forecast
- Build comparative [charts](/documentation/reporting/charts) by selecting versions from the *Sources* list in the toolbar

### Version Access and Sharing

All workspace roles (owners, admins, editors, viewers, and limited viewers) can access the version timeline and saved versions. To share specific version data with team members:

- Export your model to Excel or Sheets
- Download a [PDF report](/documentation/reporting/reports)
- Share the exported files with your team

### Version Management Guidelines

Important points to remember about working with versions:

- Versions are locked snapshots of your model at the time of saving
- You cannot edit a saved version
- Actuals will automatically update in saved versions if new entries are booked to mapped accounts for past months
- To modify a recently saved version, create a new version with your updates

By following these guidelines, you can maintain a clear history of your financial model's evolution and make meaningful comparisons between different versions.</fileContent>
