## Overview

Access the budget variance analysis through your Reports view to gain clear insights into your financial performance. This powerful tool helps you compare your actual performance against budgeted targets across three essential time periods:

- Last closed month
- Year-to-date
- Full fiscal year

You can also include forecast data to get an updated outlook on your expected year-end performance.

## Setting Up Your Analysis

### 1. Set Your Last Close Date

To ensure accurate analysis:

1. Go to [Date Settings](/documentation/modeling/date-settings)
2. Update the *last close* date to match your most recently closed accounting period
3. This setting determines which months' actuals appear in your variance analysis

### 2. Select Your Budget Version

For meaningful comparisons:

1. Choose a saved [version](/documentation/version-control/version-control) to serve as your budget baseline
2. This version will be your reference point for both monthly and year-to-date variance calculations

<Tip>
While most organizations use their start-of-year budget as the baseline, you can select any version you need. For instance, you might want to compare two reforecasts to track the evolution of your projections.
</Tip>

### 3. Choose Your Forecast Version

For full fiscal year analysis:

1. Select a forecast version to complement your actual data
2. The system will combine:
   - Actual results up to your last close date
   - Forecast figures for the remaining months

This combination provides you with the most current estimate of your year-end performance.

### 4. Customize Your Variance Display

Select your preferred method for viewing variances:

- Percentage difference
- Index comparison
- Absolute difference

Choose the format that best suits your analysis needs and reporting preferences.
