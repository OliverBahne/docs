## Overview

Effective month-end closing requires clear visibility into how your actual results compare with your budgeted figures. To support your variance analysis needs, you can use both our standard [three-column view](/documentation/variance-analysis/three-column-report) and our detailed month-by-month comparison tool. When you need to investigate specific variances, you can easily dive deeper using the [transactions drill-down](/documentation/variance-analysis/transactions-drill-down) feature.

## Getting Started

### Setting Your Last Close Date

To begin your variance analysis:

1. Complete your month-end closing process in your accounting system
2. Update the *last close* date in Francis to match your accounting system's most recently closed month
3. Francis will then automatically align your actual results with your budget for accurate comparison

<Tip>
  For successful budget comparison, ensure your *last close* date falls after your Forecast Start date. This alignment enables Francis to compare your actuals against the appropriate budget period. If your budget starts after your last closed month, there won't be any budget figures available for comparison.
</Tip>

### Viewing Your Actual Results

To review your actual performance against budget:

1. Navigate to your *Model* view
2. Locate the *Follow-up* feature in the top bar
3. Toggle the feature on to overlay your actual results onto your budget

<Tip>
  The follow-up view provides a temporary overlay of your actuals for quick comparison. It doesn't automatically update your rolling forecast with the latest actual figures. To create a new forecast based on recent actuals, you'll need to adjust your *forecast start* date. For detailed guidance on managing date settings, please refer to our date settings documentation.
</Tip>

### Analyzing Variances

To identify and understand budget variances:

1. Enable the *Compare* feature to view a month-by-month analysis
2. Review the clear presentation of variances between actual results and budget
3. Use this view to quickly spot areas that need attention or further investigation

This structured approach helps you maintain effective oversight of your financial performance and make informed decisions based on actual versus budgeted results.
