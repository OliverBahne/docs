## Overview

Transaction drill-downs enable you to more efficiently understand variances in your model. They can be viewed directly from the model view and give you a better understanding of the transactions that make up each number in your model.

## Basics

### Transactions drill-down

First, select the cell for which you want to view transactions to enable the transactions drill-down. Then, select *Transactions* from the top bar. This will open a side drawer displaying a complete list of all transactions posted from the accounts mapped to the specific rows within the selected month.

### Converted transactions

If actuals from your accounting system are converted using Francis' built-in features, both the converted and original transaction values will be accessible in the transactions drill-down. This ensures that transactions can be easily viewed and traced back to their source.

### Balance sheet transactions

Francis accumulates balance sheet accounts from accounting integrations. Note that the transactions drill-down only shows monthly posted transactions and not starting values. Consequently, if balance sheet accounts remain unchanged month over month, no transactions will appear when enabling drill-down. Read our documentation on [adjustments](https://francis.mintlify.app/integrations/accounting/e-conomic#adjustments) to learn more.
