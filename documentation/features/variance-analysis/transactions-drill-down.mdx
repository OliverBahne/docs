## Overview

The transactions drill-down feature helps you efficiently analyze and understand variances in your model. You can access detailed transaction information directly from your model view, giving you immediate insight into the specific transactions that contribute to each value.

## How to Use Transactions Drill-Down

Follow these steps to examine your transaction details:

1. Navigate to your model view
2. Select the cell containing the value you want to investigate
3. Click "Transactions" in the top bar
4. A side drawer will open, displaying all transactions from the mapped accounts for the selected month

## Understanding Your Transaction Data

### Converted Transactions
When your accounting system's actuals are converted using Francis' conversion features, you'll see both:
- The converted transaction values
- The original transaction values

This dual display ensures you can easily trace any transaction back to its source, maintaining clear visibility of your data transformation process.

### Balance Sheet Transactions
For balance sheet accounts integrated from your accounting system, Francis accumulates the values over time. Important notes:
- The transactions drill-down displays monthly posted transactions only
- Starting values are not shown in the drill-down view
- If a balance sheet account shows no change in a given month, no transactions will appear
