## Overview

Francis provides five distinct roles to help you manage your workspace effectively: Owner, Admin, Editor, Viewer, and Limited Viewer. Each role has specific permissions and access levels designed to support your team's workflow. You can manage team members' roles through your workspace settings.

## Understanding Roles

### Owner

When you create an organization, you automatically become the Owner. As an Owner, you can:
- Invite new team members
- Remove existing members
- Adjust member roles (promote or demote)
- Access all workspace features and models
- Terminate the organization when needed

<Tip>
  To transfer organization ownership to another team member, please contact our support team at support@francis.app.

### Admin

Admins maintain most Owner privileges and can:
- Invite new team members
- Remove existing members
- Adjust member roles (except for the Owner)
- Access all workspace features and models

The only difference from the Owner role is that Admins cannot terminate the organization.

### Editor

Editors focus on content and model management. They can:
- Access all models
- Create and modify account mappings
- Work on forecasting and consolidation
- Collaborate on modeling tasks

Editors cannot manage team members or terminate the organization.

### Viewer

Viewers have read-only access to your workspace. They can:
- View all models within the organization
- Download reports
- Access transaction details
- Review existing work

Viewers cannot make changes to models or workspace settings.
