## Overview

Francis currently supports five different roles – Owners, Admins, Editors, Viewers and Limited Viewers – all of which have different permissions and levels of access. You can invite, remove, promote, and demote members from the workspace members settings page.

## Basics

### Owners

The user who creates an organization is automatically assigned the Owner role. Owners have privileges to invite, remove, promote, and demote team members. They manage members through the *Members* page in settings. Owners have the exclusive privilege to terminate the organization.

<Tip>
  If you wish to transfer ownership of your organization to a different team member, please contact us at support@francis.app.

### Admins

Admins have mostly the same privileges as Owners, also being able to invite, remove, promote, and demote any team members who are not the Owner. Admins have access to all features and models, with the only exception being that Admins don't have the privilege to terminate an organization.

### Editors

Editors have many of the same privileges as Admins but cannot manage team members or terminate the organization. They have full access to all models, allowing them to collaborate closely with Admins on tasks such as modeling, account mapping, forecasting, and consolidation.

### Viewers

Viewers have full access to all models within the organization. Unlike Admins and Editors, Viewers can only view existing work and cannot make any changes. They can access features like downloading reports and viewing transaction details but are not permitted to alter models in any way.
