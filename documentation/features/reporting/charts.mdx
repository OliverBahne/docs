## Overview

Charts help you transform complex financial data into clear, meaningful visualizations. Since charts are integrated with dashboards that are accessible to all users within your organization, you'll have a consistent view of your financial data across your team.

## Creating and Managing Charts

### Getting Started with Charts

Follow these steps to create your first chart:

1. Navigate to the Model view
2. Click "Charts" in the top navigation bar
3. Select your dashboard from the side drawer that appears
   - If you haven't created a dashboard yet, visit our [Dashboard documentation] for guidance

### Available Chart Types

You can choose from five powerful visualization options:

* Line charts - Perfect for tracking trends over time
* Column charts - Ideal for comparing discrete values
* Stacked column charts - Best for showing part-to-whole relationships
* Area charts - Excellent for visualizing volume changes
* Stacked area charts - Useful for displaying cumulative trends

### Creating Your Chart

Creating a chart is straightforward:

1. Select your preferred chart type
2. Drag relevant items from your model into the chart area:
   - Individual rows
   - Groups
   - Calculations
3. Your chart will automatically generate based on the selected data

<Tip>
  Dashboard settings control the date ranges for all charts within that dashboard. While individual chart date ranges aren't currently supported, you can create separate dashboards for different date ranges to maintain flexibility in your reporting.

### Version Comparison

Take advantage of Francis's version management capabilities to gain deeper insights:

1. Navigate to the *Sources* section of your chart
2. Compare your data with:
   - Previous model versions
   - Different date ranges
   - Built-in comparison options:
     * Latest forecast version for the year
     * Current period actuals
     * Previous year's actuals for the same period

This feature enables you to make informed decisions by comparing key metrics, such as reviewing your budgeted revenue against the latest forecast while considering recent accounting data.

### Adding Charts to Reports

Incorporate your charts into professional reports effortlessly:

1. When generating a PDF report, you'll see options to include specific charts
2. Select the charts you want to include in either:
   - Month-by-month reports
   - Budget variance analysis reports

Each chart you create can enhance your reporting capabilities, helping you communicate financial insights more effectively.
