## Overview

Dashboards enable you to create organized collections of charts that effectively communicate performance across your organization. These model-specific dashboards are accessible to all team members, including those with viewing permissions, ensuring consistent data visibility throughout your team.

## Creating and Managing Dashboards

3. Name your dashboard and begin customizing it with charts

For additional dashboards:
1. Open **Charts** from the top navigation
2. Click the blue plus (+) button
3. Follow the setup prompts

<Tip>

### Configure Your Date Range

To ensure your dashboard displays the most relevant data:
