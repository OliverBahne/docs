## Overview

Dashboards allow you to create a curated selection of charts for reporting and communicating performance throughout your organization. Dashboards are model-specific, meaning that personal dashboards *cannot* be created. Consequently, dashboards are accessible to all users, including team members who are limited to a viewing role.

## Basics

### Creating dashboards

If you have not yet created a dashboard, begin by selecting *Charts* from the top bar of your model. This action will open a side drawer where you can add a new dashboard to set up your first one. If you already have existing dashboards, simply open *Charts* and click on the blue plus button to add additional dashboards.

<Tip>
  Creating separate dashboards for legal entities or dimensions will make it easier to identify the correct charts when building reports.

### Setting a date range

Each dashboard features a central date setting that determines the months displayed in the charts. To customize the timeline for your specific dashboard, select a starting and ending month from the date settings at the top of the dashboard. Any new charts added to the dashboard will automatically inherit the defined date settings.
