## Overview

Francis provides two powerful reporting options to help you create professional financial presentations: the Month-by-Month Report and the Budget Variance Report. These reports automatically update to reflect your model's current state, ensuring your presentations always show the most accurate data. When you collapse or expand groups in your model, the reports will mirror these display preferences.

## Available Reports

### Budget Variance Report

Access the Budget Variance Report through the Reports view to analyze your financial performance across multiple time periods:

- Last closed month
- Year-to-date
- Full fiscal year

You can also include forecast data to provide stakeholders with updated projections for the remaining fiscal year, helping them understand both historical performance and future outlook.

### Month-by-Month Report

The Month-by-Month Report enables you to:

- Generate comprehensive financial data for up to twelve months
- Display both actual results and forecast projections
- Create a clear overview of your full fiscal year

To enhance your presentations, consider adding charts to highlight key metrics and trends from your model.

For more detailed analysis capabilities, invite stakeholders to join your organization. This grants them access to advanced features like transaction drill-downs, allowing them to explore the data independently while maintaining your preferred view settings.
