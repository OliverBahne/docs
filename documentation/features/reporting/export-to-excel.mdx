## Overview

Export your financial models directly to Excel (.xlsx) to share with stakeholders who prefer working with spreadsheets. The exported files maintain all formulas and cell references, making it easy to meet reporting requirements for banks, investors, or board members.

## How to Export Your Model

### Export to Excel in Two Steps

1. Go to the top-right corner of your screen and click the download icon.
2. Select *Download as Excel* from the dropdown menu. Your .xlsx file will be saved to your default downloads folder.

### What to Expect in Your Excel File

Your exported Excel file preserves all the important aspects of your model:
- All formulas and cell references remain intact
- Current view settings (expanded sections and groups)
- Formatting details like bold and italicized rows
- Nested groups and rows that you can expand or collapse as needed

Unlike PDF exports, the Excel format gives you the flexibility to interact with all nested elements, allowing you to customize the view for different stakeholders.</fileContent>
