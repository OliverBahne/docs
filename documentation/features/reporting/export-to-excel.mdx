## Overview

In addition to dashboards, charts, and reports, you can export financial models directly to Excel (.xlsx), complete with formulas and cell references. This supports reporting requirements for banks, investors, or board members who prefer financials in a familiar Excel format.

## Basics

### Exporting your model

To export your financial model from Francis to Excel, click the download icon in the top-right corner and select *Download as Excel* from the dropdown. The .xlsx file will be saved to your default downloads folder.

### Dynamic states

The exported Excel file preserves the state of your model — expanded sections, groups, and formatting like bolded and italicized rows — just like with reports. However, unlike PDF reports, nested groups and rows remain accessible in Excel, allowing you to expand groups as needed.
